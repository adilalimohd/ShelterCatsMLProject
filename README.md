# ShelterCatsMLProject
This was a project I did for my data science class as I pursued my Masters degree at DePaul university. The project uses shelter data from the Austin Animal Center. The goal was to use a machine learning model to predict what factors make a cat more adoptable. The project was done in RStudio and includes a final report to discuss findings.
